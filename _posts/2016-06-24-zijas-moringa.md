# ZIJA'S MORINGA

# By Dr. Joshua Plant

Over the last 50 years we have observed the widespread commoditization of food. While it is cheaper and more readily available than ever before, the low-cost manufacturing and harvesting practices used to produce food have compromised its nutritional value. For example, 100 years ago the average person consumed around 200 grams of fiber daily; today that number is closer to 15 grams. The result is a worldwide nutritional famine.

The beneficial properties of Moringa are unparalleled and highly unique. Moringa is enriched with both water and fat-soluble vitamins, it is an excellent source of the amino acids that our body craves, and it has rare phytocompounds that aid in promoting a healthier body.

Recognizing that the nutrition in Moringa is not immune to harsh harvesting and manufacturing practices, Zija has gone above and beyond industry standards to deliver the most nutritious Moringa possible. From tree to mouth, Zija scrutinizes each step to ensure that nutrition is at the forefront of all decisions in the growing, harvesting, and manufacturing processes. I will address just a few of the steps that Zija takes to ensure that the nutrition of our products is never compromised; after all, Moringa without its nutrition becomes just another plant.

Not all Moringa is created equal. In fact, depending on where Moringa trees are grown, their nutritional content can vary significantly. Knowing this, Zija has vetted several different locations and farms where our Moringa trees will have the highest nutrient content available, even if it comes at a premium cost.

## MORINGA BLEND

Zija has created a proprietary blend that incorporates several different efficacious parts of the Moringa tree. This blend has allowed us to achieve a complementary nutritional profile. For example, even though Moringa leaves contain a lot of Vitamin C, the pods contain even more. By combining Moringa leaves, seeds, and fruit, we can maximize Moringa nutrition in products such as[SmartMix][0],[SuperMix][1],[XMprotein][2],[XMburn][3],[XM+ Energy Mix][4],[XM3 Energy Drink][5],[XMam][6], and[XMpm][7].
